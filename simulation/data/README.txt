Hi!

I have stored the relevant simulated data on an external cloud storage platform at https://rec.ustc.edu.cn/share/1e2237b0-3916-11ee-954a-7d31327db334. Due to the space limitations on Github, I have not directly uploaded this data here. You can access the data by visiting the provided URL and using the extraction password “abessdag” to download the compressed file. Once downloaded, simply extract the files to obtain the data required for the simulations.

After obtaining the data, you can run the provided Python and R code on your local machine to reproduce the experimental results discussed in the article. Should you have any questions or require further guidance, please feel free to reach out to me.
